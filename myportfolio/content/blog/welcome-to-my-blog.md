Originally I wanted to simply copy and paste entries from my journal. I don't think I'm quite there yet though. Some are a bit too cheesy and others too personal.

So this marks my first entry:

It's 12:08 AM in Ohio as I write this. Several hours ago, I withdrew from Brown University to return to Dartmouth College. Those close to me know my reasons, but ultimately it wasn't too difficult of a choice. At least not when I sent the email.

I think a part of me simply wanted an excuse to return back to Dartmouth. It felt safe. I always felt driven to take risks because everyone who I admire had taken a great risk. But I've also realized that taking risks just for the sake of taking risks isn't quite right either.

Through the transition phase of the past few months, I was constantly handed new data that changed the trajectory of my wants. At times, I wondered about the future of CS/AI. I was in a startup bubble surrounded by brilliant and enthusiastic people who made me feel at home. The culture pushed for dropouts and to pursue your dreams to the fullest. I wondered if school was even right for me. The next push took place with a full-time Founding Engineer offer at Adaptional. It was tempting, but I would have to take at least a year off from school. I loved San Francisco and its atmosphere, but ultimately decided that I valued freedom of exploration. For now, education was where I would find that. At the time, I still planned to enroll at Brown.

The final push came with a phone call I received 4 days ago. It changed the entire equation. Days later, I withdrew from Brown University. I firmly believe that I will not look back nor will I regret my choice. Dartmouth has always been my home.

Today marks two beginnings. One being the beginning of my portfolio after living the rapid and spontaneous life of San Francisco that has honed my interests and disinterests (more so the latter), the other being a new beginning at Dartmouth.

Hello Dartmouth again.
