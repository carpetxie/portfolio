Originally, I was planning on simply copy pasting entries from my journal. I don't think I'm there quite yet though. Some are a bit too cheesy. Others too personal.  


So I'll have to stick with this being my first entry. 


It's 12:08am in Ohio as I write this. Several hours ago, I withdrew from Brown University to return to Dartmouth College. Those close to me know my reasons, but ultimately it wasn't a difficult choice. I think a part of me simply wanted an excuse to return back to Dartmouth. That first excuse came with the Founding Engineer offer at Adaptional, to take a term off and return to Dartmouth, but I realized my interests lied elsewhere. Finally, four days ago, I received a call that would become the reason for why I withdrew. I firmly do not see myself looking back. 


Looking forward, I'm genuinely excited. I would call Dartmouth my home. My time here blossomed in the Spring and I can only see it becoming more beautiful as time passes. Today is August 22nd, 2025. This is the beginning of my portfolio and the new beginning of Dartmouth. 


Let's see what this next year will look like.
